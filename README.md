# About the blog

I made this blog using jekyll and used the Ed. theme. I like blogging using
jekyll because now my terminal can also be my blogging environment. I loved
blogging and created my first blog in 9th grade on wordpress. Now wordpress
seems too bloated and jekyll is much better for me. Gives me the freedom to
tinker around and I really like the idea of having a static blog that I can
update from the comfort of my terminal.
