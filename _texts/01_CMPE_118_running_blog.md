# What is this microblog sequence about? What is a microblog sequence?

## Pinned post
**Date: 09/28/17, Time: 3 PM**

I'm in my senior year at University of California, Santa Cruz taking
what is considered the hardest course on campus. Today, was the first
day of classes and I decided to start a posting on this page. I'll
continue to make these posts as I go along the course posting
pictures and writing about concepts that are interesting
or simply writing about what we've been doing in the lab. The posts
will continue on this page till the end of class and these posts could
be brief or ... long. Some of the posts might only have a picture and
a caption, hence the name microblog sequence. This post will be pinned
on top and posts following this one will follow.
