# What is this microblog sequence about? What is a microblog sequence?

## Pinned post
**Date: 09/28/17, Time: 3:00 PM**

I'm in my senior year at University of California, Santa Cruz taking
what is considered the hardest course on campus. Today, was the first
day of classes and I decided to start a posting on this page. I'll
continue to make these posts as I go along the course posting
pictures and writing about concepts that are interesting
or simply writing about what we've been doing in the lab. The posts
will continue on this page till the end of class and these posts could
be brief or ... long. Some of the posts might only have a picture and
a caption, hence the name microblog sequence. This post will be pinned
on top and posts following this one will follow.

## Post thanksgiving, Getting closer to the final
**Date: 11/24/17, Time: 6:29 PM**

We've been working on getting our sensor components working this week.
The track wire sensors are all soldered up, tested and are working.
We've saved the schematics for all the tested sensors and are in the
process of crystallizing it by putting it all on the perfboard. On the
software side, we've got the framework going and we can control our
motors using the events and services framework. We have access to the
hardware timers for timing events which means that we can now have
microsecond resolution timing! As opposed to a millisecond resolution
which we had before. This is really fun so far! Now the challenge is
to get synchronous sampling from light sensors working in time along
with tape following software. Once that is done, there will be room to
write drivers for the ultrasonic sensors. Now back to it!

## Post Lab 0 completion
**Date: 10/07/17, Time: 5:48 PM**

After finishing up the lab and on successful completion of the report
last night. Talia, Alex and I went out to celebrate the publication of
my first journal paper. We had some incredible food in downtown santa
cruz. This morning, I slept in and got some really good sleep. I have
been particular about my sleep schedule because I realized that this
is how I am able to do good work. There were days during the week when
I got an hour less sleep than usual and even that wavers my quality of
work sometimes. It was also nice to go to a BBQ that my adviser had
for our lab and reconnect with everyone in the lab. Today was a
relaxing day with a perfect balance of work and leisure (not generally
a norm this academic term).

## Lab 0 Done!
**Date: 10/06/17, Time: 11:00 AM**

After one crazy week of the class, I was checked off by the TA (teaching
assistant). This lab assignment was designed to be completed with a lab partner.
I did this lab with my good friend, James Trombadore. We had roughly five days
to finish the assignment. This assignment involved a lot of low level
programming on hardware that we were given. We had a roach robot which was
equipped with four bumpers (two in the front and two in the back) for tactile
sensing and a light sensor to check if it's light or dark. Behaviors were coded
based on the stimuli that the roach received. The fun part was figuring out the
events and services framework to program our finite state machine (FSM) and the
hierarchical state machine (HSM). 

After 5 days of working 6 hours on average, we
finished this morning. I feel mellow. As I was working on this lab, I felt
immense equanimity for the most part. Even when the robot wasn't working. Over
the years of working with robots or anything technical in that matter, I used to
feel frustrated when I was stuck. A majority of the time it doesn't go smoothly
and it's an iterative process of staying at it and getting it to work. I am more
in comfort with that process. I'm comfortable and calm in general when I'm in
engineering. I realized that in this lab that this is a good skill that I learnt
over the years. 

This lab also had a prelab where we had to hash out our designs and pseudocode
even before we begin working on the actual software and hardware. I enjoyed
doing that. I want to get in to the habit of doing that all the time. It's a lot
of fun so far.This post 
will be proofread soon.
