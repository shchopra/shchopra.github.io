<p>I got interested in Jekyll when I found out that it was a great static website
generator. I have been blogging on wordpress since 2010 but I thought that having 
a static website would be great. There are a couple reasons why I like jekyll
more than wordpress.</p>

<p>All of my workflow is setup in my terminal and when I use github to host my blog,
I can simply use my terminal to manage my blog.</p>

<p>In the long run Iâ€™m hoping to develop a system that is easily manageable, searchable
and maintainable. One of the challenges with using a software like evernote is that 
one does not own the data. They can change their policies or plans whenever they want.
If they stop supporting their software, then all the data is at risk of loss. 
As of now the best choice seems jekyll that supports latex.</p>

<p>Here is an example MathJax inline rendering \( 1/x^{2} \), and here is a block rendering: 
\[ \frac{1}{n^{2}} \]</p>
