<p>I’m in my senior year at University of California, Santa Cruz taking
what is considered the hardest course on campus. Today, was the first
day of classes and I decided to start a posting on this page. I’ll
continue to make these posts as I go along the course posting
pictures and writing about concepts that are interesting
or simply writing about what we’ve been doing in the lab. The posts
will continue on this page till the end of class and these posts could
be brief or … long. Some of the posts might only have a picture and
a caption, hence the name microblog sequence. This post will be pinned
on top and posts following this one will follow.</p>

<h2 id="lab-0-done">Lab 0 Done!</h2>
<p><strong>Date: 10/06/17, Time: 11:00 AM</strong></p>

<p>After one crazy week of the class, I was checked off by the TA (teaching
assistant). This lab assignment was designed to be completed with a lab partner.
I did this lab with my good friend, James Trombadore. We had roughly five days
to finish the assignment. This assignment involved a lot of low level
programming on hardware that we were given. We had a roach robot which was
equipped with four bumpers (two in the front and two in the back) for tactile
sensing and a light sensor to check if it’s light or dark. Behaviors were coded
based on the stimuli that the roach received. The fun part was figuring out the
events and services framework to program our finite state machine (FSM) and the
hierarchical state machine (HSM). After 5 days of working 6 hours on average, we
finished this morning. I feel mellow. As I was working on this lab, I felt
immense equanimity for the most part. Even when the robot wasn’t working. Over
the years of working with robots or anything technical in that matter, I used to
feel frustrated when I was stuck. A majority of the time it doesn’t go smoothly
and it’s an iterative process of staying at it and getting it to work. I am more
in comfort with that process. I’m comfortable and calm in general when I’m in
engineering. I realized that in this lab that this is a good skill that I learnt
over the years.</p>

<p>This lab also had a prelab where we had to hash out our designs and pseudocode
even before we begin working on the actual software and hardware. I enjoyed
doing that. I want to get in to the habit of doing that all the time. It’s a lot
of fun so far.</p>
